							<p>Chaya Czernowin was born and brought up in Israel.  After her studies in Israel, at the age of 25, she continued studying in Germany (DAAD grant), the US and then was invited to live in Japan (Asahi Shimbun Fellowship and American NEA grant) Tokyo, in Germany (at the Akademie Schloss Solitude) and in Vienna. Her music has been performed throughout the world, and she has held professorships at UCSD, and was the first woman to be appointed as a composition professor at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, Austria (2005-2009), and at Harvard University in (2009 and on) where she is the Walter Bigelow Rosen Professor of Music . Together with her husband, composer Steven Kazuo Takasugi, she has founded the summer Academy at Schloss Solitude, a biannual course for composers.</p>

						<blockquote>
							"Vital, visceral, wild and undefined as experience itself - can music be that?  I have heard such music, rarely, but, it has changed my life. Attempting to work towards it, though, is a difficult balancing act: one must be as sensually sensitive as if one has no skin, while exercising the analytical clarity, precision and focus of holding a surgeon's knife."
							<cite>—Chaya Czernowin</cite>
						</blockquote>
						<div class="two-col">	
							<p>Czernowin’s output includes chamber and orchestral music, with and without electronics. Her works were played in most of the significant new music festival in Europe and also in Japan Korea, Australia US  and Canada.  She composed 2 large scale works for the stage: Pnima...ins Innere (2000, Munich Biennale) chosen to be the best premiere of the year by Opernwelt yearly critic survey, and Adama (2004/5) with Mozart's Zaide (Salzburg Festival 2006).  Both operas have biographical and political undercurrents. She was appointed Artist in residence at the Salzburg Festival in 2005/6 and will be Artist in residence at the Lucern Festival, Switzerland in 2013. Characteristic of her work are working with metaphor as a means of reaching a sound world which is unfamiliar; the use of noise and physical parameters as weight, textural surface (as in smoothness or roughness etc), problematiszation of time and unfolding and shifting of scale  in order to create a vital, visceral  and direct sonic experience. </p>

					<p>In addition to numerous other prizes, Czernowin represented  Israel at Uncesco composer's Rostorum 1980; and was awarded the DAAD scholarship 83- 85;  Stipendiumpreis (88) and Kranichsteiner Musikpreis (92) , at the Darmstadt Fereinkurse,:  IRCAM (Paris) reading panel commission 1998; scholarships of SWR experimental Studio Freiburg 98/00/ 01; The composer’s prize of  Siemens Foundation 2003; the Rockefeller Foundation, 2004; a nomination as a fellow to the Wissenschaftkolleg Berlin in 2008; Fromm Foundation Award 2009; and  Guggenheim Foundation fellowship 2011. She is published by Schott. Her music is recorded on Mode records NY, Wergo, Col Legno, Deutsche Gramophone, Neos , Ethos, Telos and Einstein Records.   She lives near Boston with, composer Steven Kazuo Takasugi and their son. </p>

					<p>During the  first decade of the 21st century Czernowin’s work moved gradually from engaging with  the psychological to the natural arena by  creating musical objects or organisms which evolve with their own specific internal logic, at times on the border of what can be considered “logical”. The works  Maim and  Sahaf, characterize this period. Since 2010 she has written a few large orchestral pieces where she works towards avoiding  the schism  between sound as a phenomenon and time as the force which develops sound material. The works Zohar Iver, the Quiet, Esh and At the fringe of our gaze have been written from 2010-2013. These works are neither processes or sonic meditations alone. They are musical experiences attempting to be seen touched and felt through the ear. </p>

					<p>In 2013 She is composer in residence at Lucerne Festival, with a large perspective of her work, including Pnima, at the fringe of our gaze, (for WEDO and Daniel Barenboim) White wind waiting (for guitarist Stephan Schmidt and SWR with François-Xavier Roth) and a variety of  chamber pieces</p>
